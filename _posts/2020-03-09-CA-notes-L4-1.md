## Why study assembly?  
* Understand computers at a deeper level
    - Learn to write more compact and efficient code
    - Can sometimes hand optimize better than a compiler
* More sensible for minimalistic applications
    - e.g. distributed sensing and systems
    - Eliminating OS, compilers, etc. reduce size and power consumption
    - Embedded computers outnumber PCs!

## Why Reduced Instruction Set Computing(RISC) began to dominate?
* Simpler (and smaller) instruction set makes it easier to build fast hardware
* Let software do the complicated operations by composing simpler ones

## Registers
* Special locations built directly into hardware
* Benefit:  Registers are EXTREMELY FAST (faster than 1 billionth of a second)
* Drawback:  Operations can only be performed on these predetermined number of registers
>  ***<center>$\color{red}{MIPS\; Registers}$</center>***
> * MIPS has 32 registers
>   - Each register is 32 bits wide and hold a word
> * Tradeoff between speed and availability
>   - Smaller number means faster hardware but insufficient to hold data for typical C programs
> * Registers have no type (C concept); the operation being performed determines how register contents are treated

## Registers VS Memory
* What if more variables than registers?
    - Keep most frequently used in registers and move the rest to memory (called spilling to memory)
* Why not all variables in memory?
    - Smaller is faster: registers 100-500 times faster
    - Registers more versatile
      * In 1 arithmetic instruction:  read 2 operands, perform 1 operation, and 1 write
      * In 1 data transfer instruction:  1 read/write, no operation

***
## Endianness(字节序)
* Big Endian: $\color{red}{most}$-significant byte at least address of word
    - word address = address of $\color{red}{most}$ significant byte
* Little Endian: $\color{red}{least}$-significant byte at least address of word
    - word address = address of $\color{red}{least}$ significant byte
