 **Finished studying the first chapter of CA, the following things should be understood.**

## The order of this hierarchy should be understood

> e.g. The upper layer of the Operating System is Programming language**

***
## What is the interface between hardware and software?  
  Operating System

***
## The defination of computer architecture
  The attributes of a computing system as seen by the ***Machine Language Designer*** or ***Compile Program Designer.***

***
## Transparency  
   何为透明？  
   对于使用高级编程语言编写Application应用程序的程序员来说，他们看不到硬件如何运作，也就是说，硬件的运作对于程序员来说是透明的。

***
## Computer Architecture, Organization and implementation**   
   * Computer Architecture - the attributes of a  computing system as seen by the Machine Language Designer 
   * Computer Organization - Logical Implementation of Computer Architecture
   * Computer Implementation - Physical Implementation of Computer Organization
   * CA --> function of computer  
    CO --> performance of computer

***
## 区分每一类人员的工作

***
## Classification of Computer Architecture - FLYNN Classification  
based on the different organization of ***instruction flow*** and ***data flow***

***
## The Design Principle of the Computer System
   * To Accelerate High Frequency Used Components
   * Amdahl’s Law
   * Program Access Locality Principle

***
## Amdahl’s Law
Measured by speedup ratio($S_P$)
   $$S_p=\frac{Extime_{old}}{Extime{new}}=\frac{T_e}{T_o}=\frac{1}{1-f_e+(\frac{f_e}{r_e})}$$
   $f_e$指$\frac{被改良性能的组件在程序中运行的时间}{整个程序运行的总时间}$，即百分比  
   $r_e$指被改良性能的组件相较于改良之前加速了几倍  
   > If we make a function’s operation speed increased by 10 times, but this function’s operation time accounts for 40% of the entire system execution time. After this enhancement method is adopted, how many can be improved the performance of the whole system?  

   The answer:
   > $f_e$= 40%, $r_e$= 10, $S_p$=$\frac{1}{1-f_e+(\frac{f_e}{r_e})}$= 1.5625

***
## Program Access Locality Principle
   * ***Temporal locality***  **空间局部性**  
      Recently accessed code, probably will soon be accessed again
      > e.g. The loop in the advanced programming language could be an example.

      {% highlight ruby %}
      for(i=0;i<10;++i){
         a=i;
         c=a+1;
      }
      {% endhighlight %}
      
      >The code in this code block could be executed 10 times, which reflects the temporal locality.
   * ***Spatial locality***  **时间局部性**  
      The code with adjacent address may be continuous accessed
      >e.g. The cache in the computer could be an example. Some data which be stored in the cache can be accessed repeatedly, reflecting the spatical locality.

***
## Some calculations
   $$CPU\ time = the\ number\ of\ instructions \times clock\ cycles\ per\ instruction\ (CPI) \times clock\ cycle\ time$$
   $$CPI= \sum_{i=1}^n{CPI_i\times Feq_i}$$
   > e.g.A kind of computer only uses the Load/Store instructions to read or write memory. According to the results of the program tracking experiment, the proportion of each instruction and CPU clock cycles are as follows: 
    
   Instruction Type | Proportion | CPI
   :-: | :-: | :-: 
   ALU | 43% | 1
   LOAD|21%|2
   STORE|12%|2
   J|24%|2 

   > Please try to get the value of average CPI. 

   $$CPI=1\times0.43+2\times0.21+2\times0.12+2\times0.24=1.57$$
   $$MIPS(million\ instructions\ per\ second)=\frac{The\ number\ of\ instructions}{CPU\ time\times10^6}=\frac{R_c(The\ frequency\ of\ CPU)}{CPI\times10^6}$$
