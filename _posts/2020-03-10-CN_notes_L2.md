## Application architectures

### client-server
* server
    - always-on host
    - permanent IP address
    - data centers for scaling

* clients
    - communicate with server
    - may be intermittently connected
    - may have dynamic IP addresses
    - do not communicate directly with each other

### peer-to-peer(P2P)
* no always-on server
* arbitrary end systems directly communicate
* peers request service from other peers, provide service in return to other peers
    - self scalability - new peers bring new service capacity, as well as new service demands

* peers are intermittently connected and change IP addresses

    - complex management

***
## App-layer protocol defines
* types of messages exchanged

    - e.g. request, response

* message syntax

    - what fields in messages & how fields are delineated

* message semantics

    - meaning of information in fields

* rules for when and how processes sent & respond to messages

***
## What transport service does an app need?
* data integrity

    - some apps(e.g. file transfer, web transactionis) require 100% reliable data transfer
    - other apps(e.g. audio) can tolerate some loss

* timing

    - some apps(e.g. Internet telephony, interactive games) require low delay to be "effective"

* throughput

    - some apps(e.g. multimedia) require minimum amount of throughput to be effective
    - other apps("elastic apps") make use of whatever throughput they get

* security

## Internet transport protocols services

### TCP
* reliable transport between sending and receiving process
* flow control: sender won't overwhelm receiver
* congestion control: throttle sender when network overloaded
* does not provide: timing, minimum throughput guarantee, security
* connection-oriented: setup required etween client and server processes

### UDP
* unreliable data transfer between sending and receiving process
* does not provede: reliability, flow control, congestion control, timing, throughput guarantee, security, or connection setup

## HTTP
### uses TCP
* client initiates TCP connection(creates socket) to server, port 80
* server accepts TCP connection from client
* HTTP messages(application-layer protocol messages) exchanged between browser and Web server
* TCP connection closed

### stateless
* server maintains no information about past client requests

> protocols that maintain "state" are complex!  
> * past history(state) must be maintained
> * if server/client crashes, their views of "state" may be inconsistent, must be reconciled.

### HTTP connections
* non persistent HTTP

    - at most one object sent over TCP connection

        - connection then closed

    - downloading multiple objects required multiple connections

> ***<center>$\color{red}{The\; response\; time}$</center>*** 
> ![f5]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/images_of_blog/CN_notes_L2_f5.png)  
> * The issues:
>   - requires 2 RTTs per object
>   - OS overhead for each TCP connection
>   - browsers often open parallel TCP connections to fetch referenced objects


* persistent HTTP

    - multiple objects can be sent over single TCP connection between client, server

> * server leaves connection open after sending response
> * subsequent HTTP messages between same client/server sent over open connection
> * client sends requests as soon as it encounters a referenced object
> * as little as one RTT for all the referenced objects

### HTTP requests
* POST method:

    - web page often includes form input
    - input is uploaded to server in entity body

* URL method:

    - uses GET method
    - input is uploaded in URL field of request line:

        ![f6]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/images_of_blog/CN_notes_L2_f6.png) 

* Some other methods  
![f7]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/images_of_blog/CN_notes_L2_f7.png)

### HTTP response codes
![f8]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/images_of_blog/CN_notes_L2_f8.png)

### cookies
* four components:

    - cookie header line of HTTP $\color{red}{response}$ message
    - cookie header line in next HTTP $\color{red}{request}$ message
    - cookie file kept on user's host, managed by user's browser
    - back-end database at Website

> ***<center>$\color{red}{example}$</center>***
> ![f9]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/images_of_blog/CN_notes_L2_f9.png)

* cookies can be used for:

    - authorization
    - shopping carts
    - recommendations
    - user session state(Web e-mail)

> cookies and privacy:  
> * cookies permit sites to learn a lot about you
> * you may supply name and e-mail to sites

***
## Web caches(proxy server)
### Goal
satisfy client request without involving origin server

### working principle
* user sets browser: Web accesses via cache
* browser sends all HTTP requests to cache

    - object in cache: cache returns object
    - else cache requests object from origin server, then returns object to client

* cache acts as both client and server

    - server for original requesting client
    - client to origin server

### Why Web caching?
* reduce response time for client request
* reduce traffic on an institution's access link
* Internet dense with caches: enables "poor" content providers to effectively deliver content(so too does P2P file sharing)

### Conditional GET
* $\color{red}{goal:}$ don't send object if cache has up-to-date cached version  
  * no object transmission delay
  * lower link utilization

* cache: specify date of cached copy in HTTP request

{% highlight HTTP linenos%}
If-modified-since: <date>
{% endhighlight %}

* server: response contains no object if cached copy is up-to-date:

{% highlight HTTP linenos%}
HTTP/1.0 304 Not Modified
{% endhighlight %}

## electronic mail
> ***<center>$\color{red}{3\; major\; components}$</center>***
> * user agents
> * mail servers
> * simple mail transfer protocol: SMTP (between mail servers to send email messages)

### SMTP
* port 25
* uses TCP
* messages must be in 7-bit ASCII

> ***<center>$\color{red}{example}$</center>***
> ![f11]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/images_of_blog/CN_notes_L2_f11.png)

* uses persistent connections
> ***<center>$\color{red}{comparison\; with\; HTTP}$</center>***


HTTP | SMTP 
:-: | :-: 
pull | push
each objectencapsulated in its own response message| multiple objects sent in multipart message

> * both have ASCII command/response interaction, status codes

### Mail access protocols
![f12]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/images_of_blog/CN_notes_L2_f12.png)  
* POP3

    - stateless across sessions
    - "download-and-keep"——copies of messages on different clients

* IMAP

    - keeps all messages in one place: at server
    - allows user to organize messages in folders
    - keeps user state across sessions

        > **names of folders and mappings between message IDs and folder name**
