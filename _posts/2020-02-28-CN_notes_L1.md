## Internet - "nuts and bolts"（具体细节，基本要点）view

* hosts = end systems
* transmission rate: bandwidth(bps)
> 计算机网络中的带宽是指传输速率，单位为比特每秒，不同于其他领域如信号处理和通信原理中的带宽指频率之差，单位为Hz.

***
## Protocol
> Protocols define ***format***, ***order of messages sent and received among network entities***, and ***actions taken on message transmission, receipt***.

## network structure  

### network edge
* hosts 
* servers  

### access networks, physical media
* wired, wireless communication links  

### ***network core***  
* interconnected routers
* network of networks

***
## How to access networks, physical media
### digital subscriber line (DSL)
* use existing telephone line to central office DSLAM(数字用户线路接入复用器)
* upstream transmission rate: < 2.5 Mbps (typically < 1 Mbps)
* downstream transmission rate: < 24 Mbps (typically < 10 Mbps)  

### cable network (有线网络)
* frequency division multiplexing (FDM) - different channels transmitted in different frenquency bands

> network of cable, fiber attaches homes to ISP router
> * homes share access network to cable headend
> * unlike DSL, which has dedicated access to central office

***
## network - core 
### Two key functions
* routing: determines source-destination route taken by packets
* forwarding: move packets from router's input to appropriate router output  

### circuit switching
> FDM: 每个用户的数据被调制成不同的频率被同时发送  
TDM: 时间被切分成时间片，每个时间片再被分成N（用户数）个小时隙，每个用户只能在自己的时隙内发送数据

### packet switching vs circuit switching
* packet switching allows more users to use network!
* Advantages: great for bursty data
   - resource sharing
   - simpler, no call setup
* Disadvantages: excessive congestion possible, packet delay and loss
   - protocols needed for reliable data transfer, congestion control

***
## dalay, loss, throughput in networks
### How do loss and delay occur?
* packets queue in router buffers
   - packet arrival rate to link(temporarily) exceeds output link capacity
   - packets queue, wait for turn  

### Throughput
* rate(bits/time unit) at which bits transferred between sender/receiver  

***
## protocol layers
### Why layering?
> dealing with complex systems:
> * explicit structure allows identification, relationship of complex system's pieces
>   - layered reference model
> * modularization eases maintenance, updating of system
>   - change of implementation of layer's service transparent to rest of system
>   - e.g. change in gate procedure doesn't affect rest of system
